## JavaScript Magic

JavaScript is a powerful programming language that runs in the browser and allows you to add interactivity to your websites. Here's a simple JavaScript code snippet to illustrate:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to the world of JavaScript.`;
}

console.log(greet('Ajinkya'));
```

Output: Hello, Ajinkya! Welcome to the world of JavaScript.
